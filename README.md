# Snap.Js

The copy-past library.

## Commands

- `npm run predeploy` to run prettier and tests
- `npm run deploy` to publish this webpage. `predeploy` is autorun, I believe, but it won't stop it from deploying if there's errors or changes.
- `npm run test` to run tests
- `npm run lint-fix` to auto-run prettier
- `npm run start` to run the webpage in development mode. Currently, if you change anything in content/ you'll have to rerun this command to receive the changes.
