```javascript
function updateWith(object, path, updater, customizer) {
  // Optional string-path support.
  // You can remove this `if` block if you don't need it.
  if (typeof path === 'string') {
    const isQuoted = str => str[0] === '"' && str.at(-1) === '"';
    path = path.split(/[.\[\]]+/)
      .filter(x => x)
      .map(x => !isNaN(Number(x)) ? Number(x) : x)
      .map(x => typeof x === 'string' && isQuoted(x) ? x.slice(1, -1) : x);
  }

  if (path.length === 0) {
    throw new Error('The path must have at least one entry in it');
  }

  const [head, ...tail] = path;

  if (tail.length === 0) {
    object[head] = updater();
    return object;
  }

  let pathSegment = customizer(object[head], head, object);

  if (pathSegment !== undefined) {
    object[head] = pathSegment;
  } else if (!(head in object)) {
    object[head] = typeof tail[0] === 'number' ? [] : {};
  }

  updateWith(object[head], tail, updater, customizer);
  return object;
}
```

Note that the support for string paths in the above `updateWith()` implementation isn't very robust. It'll take invalid-looking input, such as `"prop1.[prop2"`, ignore the invalid parts, and attempt to work with it anyways. Lodash's `_.updateWith()` isn't all that different in this regard. If you really need support for string inputs, like this, it's recommended to build out your own mini-parser, according to your specific use-cases. For everyone else, there shouldn't be a real reason to need this capability with the modern syntax that JavaScript provides.
